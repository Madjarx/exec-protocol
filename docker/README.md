# How To Dockerize Your Hardhat Solidity Contract

This is the final code from the article "How To Dockerize Your Hardhat Solidity Contract On Localhost".
This is a base from the sample project provided by Hardhat but configured to use it with Docker.

## Requirements

- NVM or NodeJS `v14.17.6`
- Docker `v20.10.8`
- Yarn `v1.22.10`

## Local Setup

1. Make sure you have the correct version of NodeJS

```bash
nvm install;
```

2. In dependencies

```bash
yarn install; # or just yarn
```

3. Compile contract

```bash
yarn compile:local; # this is for our client/node.js file
```

4. Build Docker image

```bash
docker build . -t hhdocker;
```

5. Run Docker image

```bash
# !NOTE: Double check no other programs are using that port 8545
docker run -it -d -p 8545:8545 --name myhd hhdocker;
```

6. Verify that container is running

```bash
docker logs myhd;
# Should see an output of wallet addresses and private keys
```

7. Compile local contract within Docker

```bash
docker exec -it myhd yarn compile:local;
```

8. Deploy local contract within Docker with custom task

```bash
docker exec -it myhd yarn deploy:local;
```

9. Create `.env` file used for out `client/node.js` file

```bash
# Ugly version
echo "CONTRACT_ADDRESS=$(docker exec -it myhd cat .contract)\nWALLET_ADDRESS=$(docker exec -it myhd cat .wallet;)" > .env;

# Prettier version
# export CONTRACT_ADDRESS="$(docker exec -it myhd cat .contract)";
# export WALLET_ADDRESS="$(docker exec -it myhd cat .wallet)";
# echo "CONTRACT_ADDRESS=$CONTRACT_ADDRESS\nWALLET_ADDRESS=$WALLET_ADDRESS" > .env;
# unset CONTRACT_ADDRESS;
# unset WALLET_ADDRESS;
```

10. Run our client

```bash
node client/node.js;
```

Voil√†!

Don't forget to delete your container when you're done.

```bash
docker rm -f myhd;
```

## Running Tests

Main test files can be found in `/test`.

```bash
yarn test:local;
```
